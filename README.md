# JLPT Vocabulary in JSON and CSV Formats
The original files from: https://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/ are formatted in difficult to read file structures like .anki, .mem, .doc, .pdf. 
This Project aims to provide a clean, lossless and easy format for these files.<br>
<br>To get the raw files (like in dataRaw) I downloaded Anki Version 2.0.52 and the .anki file for each JLPT level.<br>
Afterwhich I deleted the meaning field in Anki and exported the deck as a .txt file then cleaned the file up.<br>
These files in .txt format are available in the "data/rawData" folder.<br>

You can download the files here: https://github.com/Bluskyo/JLPT_Vocabulary/releases/tag/v1.0
